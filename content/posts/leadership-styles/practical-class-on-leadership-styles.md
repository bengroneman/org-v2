title: A practical class on leadership styles
---

## Overview
This exercise can be helpful for teams to legitimize differences in leadership archetypes by allowing participants to see how their self perception differs from the perspective of others. It also fosters a healthy discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of each leader type, by breaking them into the following categories:

- **Architect & Analyst** (emphasizes meaning and conceptual functions)
- **Relationship Master** (emphasizes caring function)
- **Driver** (emphasizes action and directing functions)
- **Spontaneous Motivators** (emphasizes emotional stimulating function)

This exercise has been adapted from the NOLS Leadership Education Handbook to fit a remote environment. While also branching off of the Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators and its focus on the leadership functions mentioned above.
