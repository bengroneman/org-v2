# About me
I am a DevOps Engineer with a track record for helping my community grow with technology. I volunteer for our local [Jurassic Classic Bike Festival](https://www.jurassicclassicfest.com) every year, and I volunteer to manage the website for [Almost Home Wyoming](https://almosthomewyoming.org), an organization helping to make an impact on homelessness in Wyoming.

I am studying at [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu), and currently in pursuit of a Bachelors Degree in Data Analytics.

I am working with Language I/O as a DevOps Engineer to expand and maintain infrastructure for new and existing services. I spend my days working on automation and building out resilient systems. I focus on People > Process > Tools to maintain operational efficiency.

Language I/O is a Cheyenne WY based company focused delivering the most accurate real time translation service for business. They have an *amazing* culture, and incredible senior management (not endorsed), [come join us](https://languageio.com/careers) and find out for yourself!
