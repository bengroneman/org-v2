# About me
I am an avid developer with a passion for helping my community grow with technology. Most recently I have built a website for a non-profit known as Almost Home Wyoming, an organization that helps folks go from homeless to hopeful with just a little help. Before that I was working with the Water for Wildlife foundation to build an exciting museum exhibit. The exhibit can be found at the Water for Wildlife museum (545 Main street, Lander Wyoming).

I attended school at Central Wyoming College, and earned my Associates degree in Computer Science (2018). While in school I also worked as a Front-End Developer with Wyoming Inc. During my time there I learned how to build quality websites with Wordpress using a custom PHP framework

I have spent over eight years working in IT, and building cool stuff on the web. Currently I work as a Lead QA Automation Engineer with Language I/O.

Language I/O is a company providing multilingual customer support services to a global audience. I spend time automating a full suite of End-to-End tests across multiple CRMs and tools.

With over eight years of experience in Web Development and IT service experience I would love to join you on your next project. Feel free to use the form on the right, or email me directly about your next project.
